# Los Altos High School Club Day Website

## About the Website

### Description
This website seeks to emulate LAHS' annual club day, but in a virtual fashion. Its core functionality is providing a sorted list of clubs based off personal interests, effectively minimizing the amount of clubs glossed over while strengthening the user's incentive to join. The current version is available at [https://clubday-df776.web.app/](https://clubday-df776.web.app/).
